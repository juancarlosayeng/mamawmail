Module: Delivery Feedback and Signal Handler
--------------------------------------------

Handles downstream signaling mechanisms in the Intelligent Fractal Propagation Protocol (IFPP).
Responsible for:
    - Receiving and interpreting delivery confirmations
    - Triggering upstream deletion of intermediate nodes after successful delivery
    - Sending failure or retry signals when propagation fails
    - Updating local relay logs and path memory
    - Supporting real-time pruning of active paths to preserve bandwidth and storage

Part of the MAMAWMAIL core protocol, this module supports a decentralized, self-cleaning
propagation model across a peer-to-peer swarm.

Usage:
    Called by `relay_manager.py` and optionally by path scoring or monitoring subsystems.
