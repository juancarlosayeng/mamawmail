# Core Pre-Alpha Snapshot â€“ June 20, 2025

This directory contains the **first experimental implementation** of the MAMAWMAIL core logic.  
It was created before the formal Alpha specification (2025-08-16) and is kept here for historical and reference purposes.

## Files
- `feedback/return_signals.py`  
  Prototype for handling return signals in message hops.

- `ledger/path_scores.db`  
  Early database sketch for path scoring. Format and schema were experimental.

- `swarm_engine/relay_manager.py`  
  First attempt at a relay management engine. Contained basic swarm-like logic for device hops.

## Notes
- These files represent **initial concepts** and are **not compatible** with the current Alpha version.  
- They are archived here to preserve the development history.  
- The current active specification is:  
  `mamawmail/core/mamawmail/core_alpha_v1.0_2025_08_16.md`
