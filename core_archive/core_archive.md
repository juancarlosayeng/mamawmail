# Core Archive Index

This document serves as the index of all major core architecture iterations of **MAMAWMAIL**.  
Each archived core is preserved for reference, testing, and historical traceability.  
New development should always build on the **current active core**, while old cores remain frozen.

## Archived Cores

### üÖ∞ Core Alpha
- **Date**: 2023-12-10  
- **Summary**: First conceptual implementation of the Intelligent Fractal Propagation Protocol (IFPP).  
- **Highlights**:
  - Manual packet hopping across nodes.
  - Fractal expansion up to hop depth = 5.
  - ‚ÄúBeen-here‚Äù marker introduced.  
- **Limitations**:
  - No AI routing.  
  - No self-healing.  
- **Full details**: [core_alpha/core_alpha.md](core_alpha/core_alpha.md)

### üÖ± Core Beta
- **Date**: 2024-05-05  
- **Summary**: Stabilized experimental build with clearer modular splits.  
- **Highlights**:
  - Added **Crawler** prototype for candidate device discovery.  
  - Introduced **Privacy Layer** (basic encryption, header masking).  
  - Early **Adaptive Topology Maintenance** tests.  
- **Limitations**:
  - AI system not yet integrated.  
  - Singularity handling incomplete.  
- **Full details**: [core_beta/core_beta.md](core_beta/core_beta.md)
