Module: Test Suite — Adaptive Topology
--------------------------------------

Validates the adaptive reconfiguration of swarm topology in real-time.
Responsible for:
    - Testing self-healing of swarm under node failure
    - Verifying adaptive reshaping of relay paths
    - Measuring efficiency of redundant path minimization
    - Ensuring topology changes preserve delivery assurance
    - Confirming compliance with privacy constraints during reshaping

Usage:
    Run via pytest to ensure swarm topology adapts effectively under stress.
