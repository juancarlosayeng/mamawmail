Module: Test Suite — AI Engine
------------------------------

Validates the AI-assisted path scoring and adaptive decision-making.
Responsible for:
    - Testing GNN/ML-based relay scoring accuracy
    - Comparing AI scoring vs. baseline heuristic
    - Evaluating adaptive path re-routing under network changes
    - Checking learning persistence across test runs
    - Validating safe fallback when AI engine fails

Usage:
    Run via pytest to confirm reliability of AI-driven path scoring.
