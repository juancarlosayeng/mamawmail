## 🌐 Project Intent  

MAMAWMAIL is an experimental decentralized messaging and relay system built on the **Intelligent Fractal Propagation Protocol (IFPProtocol)**.  
This project aims to remove reliance on centralized servers, instead leveraging swarm-like device-to-device propagation, fractal growth rules, and AI-assisted path optimization.  

This file acts as a **living declaration** of the project’s current state. It serves as both:  
1. A **version stamp** for the core design.  
2. A **guide for archival and transition** between development phases.

## 🏷 Naming Convention  

- **<phase>** → Major development phase (`alpha`, `beta`, `gamma`).  
- **<version>** → Version number within that phase (e.g., `v1.0`, `v2.0`).  
- **<date>** → File creation date in `YYYY-MM-DD`.  
- **.md** → Markdown format.  

**Example Files:**  
- `core_alpha_v1.0_2025-08-16.md`  
- `core_alpha_v2.0_2025-09-01.md`  
- `core_beta_v1.0_2025-09-10.md`

## 📌 Phase and Version Rules  

### 1. Sequential Phases  
- **Alpha** = Exploratory, high-change stage (architecture in flux).  
- **Beta** = Stable refinement, fewer drastic overhauls.  
- **Gamma/Release** = Production stability + final polish.  

### 2. Versions Within a Phase  
- Increment version number (`v2.0`, `v3.0`, …) for **major architectural changes within the same phase**.  

### 3. Hybrid Rule (Recommended)  
- Stay in **Alpha** until architecture matures.  
- Use **v2.0, v3.0** to track internal redesigns.  
- Advance to **Beta** once the design is stable and refinement begins.

## 🔹 Version Notes – Alpha v1.0  

- ✅ Initial system design frozen for Alpha review.  
- ✅ Naming + archival convention established.  
- 🔜 Next steps: simulation testing → prepare draft for **Beta refinements**.
